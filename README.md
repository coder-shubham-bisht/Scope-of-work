# Scope of Work (SOW)  

## 1️⃣ Project Overview  
Describe what the project is about and why it’s being done.  

## 2️⃣ Objectives  
Define the main goals of the project, such as:  
- Migrating from a **monolithic architecture** to **microservices**.  
- Improving **scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance**.  

## 3️⃣ Deliverables  
List the expected outputs of the project, such as:  
- **Microservices architecture blueprint**.  
- **Service API documentation**.  
- **Deployed and tested microservices**.  

## 4️⃣ Tasks & Activities  
Detail the specific work to be done:  
- **Identify services** to extract from the monolith.  
- **Design APIs** for communication between services.  
- **Refactor codebase** and migrate functionalities.  
- **Implement database strategy** (shared DB → independent DBs).  
- **Set up DevOps & deployment pipeline** (Docker, Kubernetes).  
- **Testing & validation** before production rollout.  

## 5️⃣ Timeline & Milestones  
Define estimated **duration and key checkpoints**, such as:  
- **Phase 1:** Service Identification (Week 1-2)  
- **Phase 2:** API Development & Database Migration (Week 3-6)  
- **Phase 3:** Service Deployment & Testing (Week 7-10)  
- **Phase 4:** Full Migration & Monitoring (Week 11-12)  

## 6️⃣ Roles & Responsibilities  
Assign key roles:  
- **Developers:** Service extraction & API development.  
- **DevOps Engineers:** CI/CD setup, containerization, infrastructure.  
- **QA Team:** Functional, integration, and performance testing.  
- **Database Admins:** Data migration & consistency.  

## 7️⃣ Success Criteria  
Define how the project’s success will be measured:  
- ✅ Each microservice is independently **deployable & scalable**.  
- ✅ **No major downtime** during migration.  
- ✅ Performance **improves by X%** after migration.  
- ✅ Faster **release cycles** due to independent deployments.  

## 8️⃣ Risks & Mitigation  
Identify potential challenges & how to handle them:  
- **Data inconsistency risks** → Implement **event-driven architecture**.  
- **Latency issues** → Optimize **API calls & caching**.  
- **Security concerns** → Use **API Gateway, OAuth2, JWT**.
